# centresquare-db: open-source JSON database for AFL

Designed around the needs of [Centre Square](https://github.com/jmrein/centresquare),
but free to use and reproduce.

In order to use these in a Firebase database, the various `*.json` files will need to be combined into a single JSON file which can be imported (they are separate files for git convenience).
